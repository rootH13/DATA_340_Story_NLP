This project represents an exploratory analysis aimed at deciphering the quintessential elements that constitute a compelling story. Additionally, it seeks to utilize these insights to guide the text-generation capabilities of an AI, with the end goal of crafting narratives that rival the quality of the classic literature dataset I examined. My inspiration stems from AI Dungeon, an app launched in 2019, which harnesses Dungeons and Dragons-like story presets and leverages OpenAI's text-generation through user inputs. The app, highly engaging in its free version, prompted me to delve into the intricacies of story generation, aspiring to reach the narrative heights of time-honored fictional works.
